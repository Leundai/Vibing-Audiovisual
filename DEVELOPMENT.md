# Development

---
- **4/17/20** Figured out how to include Simplex Library
    - I still need to figure out how to include the pretzel ui cinderblock
    - However I have gotten great success after a decent amount of hours throughout the day!
    
- **4/18/20** Added PretzelUI library to project
    - Simple enough due to the case study that was given in the tutorial
    - Most of the battle for developing this project is finished so now its all about developing
    
- **4/19/20** Implemented Camera Perspective and 3D TriangleStrip View
    - Finally after following through a simplex noise tutorial I was able to follow a similar path of showing the strips
    - They are not noise influenced nor do they update yet how I would want them to for amplitudes

- **4/20/20** Dynamically changing Z Values for triangle strips with Noise!
    - Using the Simplex Noise and feeding it the x and y values of each block I was able to get some noise and map it
    - It looks very mountainous! At the same time it it finally one step closer to that of music visualizer
    - **TODO**
    - [ ] Create the ability to put in a song and influence the noise values!
    - [ ] Either real time process the music and update the terrain while playing or process it before playing
